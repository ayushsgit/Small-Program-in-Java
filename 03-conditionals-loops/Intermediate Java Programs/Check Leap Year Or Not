//To check if a year is a leap year, there are several methods:
//
//    Divisibility by 4: Any year that is evenly divisible by 4 is a leap year
//                       For example, 1988, 1992, and 1996 are leap years.
//    Divisibility by 100: If a year is evenly divisible by 100, it is not a leap year, unless it is also evenly divisible by 400. For example, 1900 was not a leap year, but 2000 was
//    Divisibility by 400: A century year (a year ending in 00) is a leap year only if it is perfectly divisible by 400. For example, 1600 and 2000 were leap years, but 1700, 1800, and 1900 were not
